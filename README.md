# Apple iTunes Music Analysis Project


This project focuses on performing an end-to-end data analysis for an Apple iTunes digital music store. The goal is to transform raw CSV data into a structured relational database (PostgreSQL), extract actionable business insights using SQL queries, and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) through a business dashboard (Power BI).

Problem Statement
Apple iTunes maintains a large digital music store with millions of tracks, thousands of customers worldwide, and a network of employees managing sales operations. To support business expansion, the leadership team requires deeper insights into customer behavior, music preferences, and overall sales performance.

Business Goals
The primary business goals for this analysis are to:

Understand customer behavior and purchasing trends.

Identify the most and least popular music genres, tracks, and artists.

Evaluate sales performance by employees and customer regions.

Analyze revenue trends across time and product types.

Uncover growth opportunities by identifying underutilized content or inactive customers.

Key Deliverables
Database Setup: Fully set up PostgreSQL database with all tables and relationships defined, populated with data from CSVs.
